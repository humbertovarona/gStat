abstract: >-
  Geostatistics is a branch of applied statistics that focuses on the analysis
  and modeling of spatial and geographic phenomena. It uses mathematical and
  statistical methods to study and predict the distribution of variables that
  vary in space, such as the concentration of minerals in the soil, air quality
  in a region, or the distribution of species in an ecosystem. Through techniques
  like kriging, geostatistics allows for the interpolation and estimation of
  values in unsampled areas, providing precise maps and models that are
  essential for decision-making in fields like geology, hydrology, agronomy, and
  urban planning. This discipline integrates spatial data with contextual
  information to offer a more comprehensive and detailed view of the studied
  environment, thus contributing to better management and utilization of natural
  resources.

  A software that performs geostatistical analysis is essential because it
  allows users to process and analyze spatial data efficiently and accurately.
  Its importance lies in several key aspects:

  1- Precision in Decision Making: By providing accurate maps and models of the
  distribution of spatial variables, it helps make informed decisions in fields
  like geology, hydrology, agronomy, and urban planning.
  2- Interpolation and Estimation: It uses advanced techniques like kriging to
  estimate values in unsampled areas, allowing for a more comprehensive
  understanding of the studied phenomenon without the need for exhaustive
  sampling.
  3- Handling Large Volumes of Data: It can process large sets of spatial data,
  facilitating the analysis of trends and patterns in environmental and natural
  resource studies.
  4- Resource Optimization: It helps identify areas of interest or concern,
  enabling better management and utilization of natural resources, as well as
  the implementation of mitigation measures in problematic areas.
  5- Data Integration: It allows for the integration of spatial data with
  contextual information, offering a holistic view of the environment and
  improving the understanding of interactions between different variables.
